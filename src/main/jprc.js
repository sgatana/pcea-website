          <h6>Building Capacities for Peace and Reconciliation</h6>
          <p>
            Sustainable peace in Kenya, will only be realized when
            we each discover that our individual and collective actions
            constitute choices either for peace or violence. The church,
             while not offering all the answers, holds the possibility
             that we can begin to build biblical foundations for peace
             and reconciliation. This programme trains church leaders
             to acquire the essential knowledge and skills needed for
             reconciliation and the mediation process. It aims at strengthening
             local capacities to develop creative strategies for interventions
             within communities and to work towards
            conflict prevention, resolution and peaceful co-existence.

          <h6>Research and Policy Formulation</h6>
          <p>
          The conditions of peace building and conflict management are dynamic.
           This presents an ongoing need for critical analysis through
            research. By undertaking research the church will be able to 
            generate and share new ideas on appropriate ways of dealing 
            with conflict. The research component will also help the 
            church to have a deeper understanding of the causal factors 
            of conflict. The Peace Desk, in collaboration with all 
            stakeholders, will engage in policy research, policy generation,
             dissemination, sensitization and advocacy. The establishment 
             of a national peace resource centre as a reference point for
              documenting disseminating 
          best practice in peace building and reconciliation

          <h6>Governance and Human Rights</h6>
          <p>
          Governance denotes a process through which political, social and 
          economic priorities are based on the broader consensus in society
           in which the voices of the citizens (in particular the less able) 
           are heard and respected in decision making and allocation of
            resources. This programme aims to promote civic awareness through 
            trains and sensitizing the public on important national issues.
